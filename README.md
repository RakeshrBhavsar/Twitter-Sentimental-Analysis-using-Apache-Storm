Predicting Georgia General Election with Twitter Sentimental Analysis using Apache Storm

In this project, we address the problem of sentiment classification on twitter dataset that will be collected from the 2018 
Georgia gubernatorial election which is going to be held on November 6, 2018. We will attempt to perform sentiment analysis 
of tweets using various machine learning algorithms as well as natural language processing. Using above techniques, we will 
try to classify the polarity of the tweets either as positive,negative or neutral. Based on classification, we will make 
predictions to know who is likely to win the Governor of Georgia race. In this paper, techniques are discussed to perform 
sentiment analysis based on textual data collected from social media platforms.
